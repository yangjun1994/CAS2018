# CAS2018 ICN traffic datasets README
## Files
CAS2018.zip

-attack.type - Attack Type defined in this datasets

-publicserver.na - Network Address of Public Servers

-sensors.na - Network Address of Sensors used in this ICN

-computers.na - Network Address of Computers connected to this ICN

-ncs.log - NCS logs

-nrs.log - NRS logs

-devices.key - Devices and their keys


## Notes
Researchers do the attack in special time, so in your analysis, DROP THE DETIAL TIME INFO

For privacy and security reason, we did these:

Hash 'ALL' the Network Addresses(Some Unknown Devices use '4035753d909daf85630e94c5a1ab9af3444caadd')

Hash 'ALL' the Keys

Remove detail payload data of packets, but give a packet size for analysis
